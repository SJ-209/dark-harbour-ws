        We are Dark Harbour Studios a film production company creating high-impact, cinematic storytelling. From gritty documentaries to action-packed brand films, we capture raw, immersive moments that stand out.
        </p>
        
        <p className="text-sm leading-relaxed mb-8">
        we thrive in high-pressure, high-stakes environments where others might hesitate. Born in the mountains and sharpened by challenges, our team runs headlong into the chaos of filmmaking on set, in the edit, or anywhere the story leads.
        </p>
        
        <p className="text-sm leading-relaxed mb-8">
        Dark Harbour doesnâ€™t fake it. We capture real moments, real people, and real stakes on screen and in post. We believe in keeping it raw, keeping it honest, and uploading it with intention because storytelling at altitude needs more than polish. It needs courage.
